# prooftutorassistant
long story of the project: project that came out of work on an automated proof assistant. in the same light, following this, took the liberty and began a project directed towards serving as a proof assistant for incomplete partial differential equations. the reason for the specialization is due to my understanding of PDEs, therefore ease in writing some of the math operations and understanding the processes behind this implementation.

the book Building LLMs for production by Bouchard and Peters was invaluable in this regard for learning LLM implementation. 

a citation that cannot be understated: this implementation is a variation on karpathy's implementation of nanogpt -which in its own words, prefers "teeth over education". 

this is a work in progress.... currently comparable to gpt2
